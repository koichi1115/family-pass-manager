This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a family password management web system designed to securely store and manage passwords for family members.

## Architecture

This project is currently in the initial setup phase. The architecture and technology stack are yet to be determined based on the requirements.

## Security Considerations

- Never commit actual passwords, API keys, or sensitive credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow secure coding practices for password storage (hashing, salting)
- Ensure HTTPS is used for all communications

## Development Notes

- Project folder: `family-pass-manager`
- Technology stack and build commands will be added once the project structure is established
